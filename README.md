# Mental health transformer counselor

# Introduction
In recent years, mental health issues have become increasingly prevalent across the globe. This rise is not limited to any single demographic; rather, it affects individuals of all ages, professions, and social statuses. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately one in four people will experience a mental health condition at some point in their lives. This statistic underscores the universality of mental health challenges and the pressing need for societal recognition and comprehensive approaches to address them.

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, AI models have emerged as powerful tools with the potential to revolutionize many fields, including mental health care. Large Language Models can be helpful for mental health care by acting as AI counselors, providing accessible and immediate support to a wide range of users. They can offer personalized interactions, educate on mental health topics, and identify early signs of distress. While not a replacement for human therapists, LLMs can supplement traditional therapy by providing continuous support and resources. Ethical use and integration into existing care systems are crucial to ensure their effectiveness and safety in addressing the mental health crisis.

As we navigate the complexities of the global mental health crisis, the integration of AI into mental health care offers a promising avenue to expand access and enhance support. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, we can create more inclusive and responsive mental health systems that address the diverse needs of individuals. Ethical and thoughtful implementation of AI tools can help us move closer to a future where mental health care is accessible, personalized, and continuously available for all.

# Goals of the project

The primary aim of this project is to explore the potential of LLMs to recognize and respond to nuanced patterns related to mental health, effectively emulating the role of a therapist or counselor. The project relies on state-of-the-art implementation of transformer in *Attention is all you need* (2017) paper. More specific goals of the project are:

- gather and prepare dataset for mental health counseling,

- implement from scratch transformer model architecture according to *Attention is all you need* paper,

- train model so it will give reasonable and well structured response sentences according to the given input
